Enabling Circular and Sustainable Clothing in Your Wardrobe

Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring recommendation algorithms that are available and applying it to create recommendation models that can nudge the consumers to make sustainable clothing choices.

Two Recommendation models were developed :
- a Random Forest Classifier Model is trained to classify items based on the likelihood of item aligning with user's preferences, using features such as material composition, brand and style.
- a Content-Based Recommendation Model is developed to enhance the recommendation process. This model calculates the similarity between items using cosine similarity based on their attributes, enabling the recommendation of items that are not only similar to those the user likes but also score high on sustainability measures. Additionally we could the model is also developed to recommend items based on the percentage of composition of particular fiber.

Please follow these steps to set up and run the recommendation models on your local machine:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/avrekha/recommendation-models.git
cd recommendation-models

Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Application:
Instructions on how to run each model, including any necessary command line arguments or environment setup.
